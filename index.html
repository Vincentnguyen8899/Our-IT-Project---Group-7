        <br>Name: Nguyen Viet Lam Tung
        <br>Student number: S3891452
        <br>Background: 1st year at RMIT
        <br>Hobbies: playing video games, researching and watching some short videos about IT technologies.
        <br>IT interest: creating a video game which can combine security about the network into a game in order to reduce the interruption of the network while the user is playing and enjoying a game is my target. However, the first step to achieve my dream is  to contribute to this project and learn some skills, some special aspects that come from thí project.
        <br>IT experience: beginner at Python and Java, learned some basic MySQL language from previous course.
        <br>
        <br>Name: Tran Chi Toan
        <br>Student number: S3891637
        <br>Background: 1st year at RMIT,
        <br>Hobbies: playing video games, watching TV shows and movies. However, if eating is considered a hobby, I would rank it my most favourite.
        <br>IT interest: creating a video game that makes people can’t stop playing and obsess about it is my dream. While programming or dealing with codes sounds frustrating and boring to people (at least my family), it gives me joy especially when problems are solved.This project is about an interactive system which could also get people to obsess with it, so I think this might be the first step.
        <br>IT experience: beginner at Python and Java, learned some basic MySQL language from last course.</p>
    <h3>Group processes:</h3>
      <p>People are paired by teachers because the group is lacking people at the start, rather than coming together through research. Due to the epidemic and the fact that some members were going through a difficult time, communication was initially difficult. After several meetings, however, everyone has agreed to work on this project together.
	      <br>If the deadline is extended in the future, we will consider testing the mobile app, improving the UI/UX, adding emojis to comments, adding a clock feature to time cooking, or renaming the app to be more professional.</p>
    <h3>Career Plans:</h3>
      <p>The majority of the team members are interested in pursuing a future career in technology or programming. Because the majority of the group's young members were born in the late 90s and early 2000s, everyone considers to be video games developers as a part of their childhood, the story of three members in the group, Chi, Tung, and Hieu, who all want to make a hit game, is understandable; additionally, Hieu is known to be a very passionate music person, and if he can't join a system development team, he can technically work for music concerts. Quan, on the other hand, took a detour rather than pursue a career in game development, cryptocurrency, or blockchain development, a bold move that few predicted.</p>

    <h2>Project description:</h2>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>Topic:
        <br>Many people in Vietnam are currently interested in the topic of cuisine. The number of people watching food videos on popular social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok is rapidly increasing. Not only do Vietnamese people enjoy learning the recipes for delicious dishes from all over the world, but they also enjoy learning the recipes for dishes from all over the world.
        <br>As a result, our team decided to create a playground where foodies could interact and share recipes, as well as a massive culinary library entirely devoted to Vietnamese people. Learning and exchanging experiences, saying no to negativity, and being user-friendly are all criteria.
        <br>
        <br>Motivation:
        <br>Vietnamese people who enjoy trying new dishes from all over the world will likely benefit from the project. For instance, our mother occasionally searches the internet for new cooking recipes, but they always question how to save or share them with neighbors and relatives. So we decided to create RecipeBook, which is designed to be simple to use by people of all ages. With some additional app functions, it allows people to save recipes they want to try cooking or easily post their recipes.
        <br>
        <br>Landscape:
	      <br>First of all, RecipeBook is designed for users, unlike most of other Cooking Recipe websites, 100% recipes here are uploaded by users. If other users love the recipe, that post will be more likely to be suggested in other user walls.
	      <br>Second, the posting feature here is specialized and is very easy for users to use. It doesn’t just contain a page that users have to type and organize everything in order to post a beautiful recipe, it contains tabs, photos, suggestions that organizes everything so even an 8-year-old child can post a recipe (but if no one likes it, it won’t appear much in other users' walls).</p>
    <h3>Detailed Description: </h3>
    <h3>1. Aims:</h3>
      <p>The aim of this project, as well as the first milestone of this app, is to implement a fully functional version on the website that contains features, which will be stated later in this report. The goal is to develop and test all the core features of the prototype as if it is ready to be published. In order to obtain this aim, sub-goals will be created to encourage the team members to work on their best.
      <br>Sub-goals:
      <ul>
        <li>Account: For this goal to be reached, testers must be able to register and log into the application. The account must be able to send and receive users’ information from the application’s database. The account feature must also be able to receive token from Facebook and automatically generate an account for uses.</li>
        <li>Profile: This is a part of the information which will be received from the database. The main goal of this feature is to arrange and display different layers of information in a given preset. The information that will be received contains text (user’s name, bio, nickname, etc), date (date of birth, date joined) or image (avatar, background photo, etc).</li>
        <li>Posting: This feature is basically a personal database of each account that stores data of user’s posts since the creation of that account. The data that will be stored in this database are Title (text), Ingredient (list of text), Unit (list of number representing ingredient amount) and Step (long text).</li>
        <li>User interaction: The most challenging part of this project is to implement a fully functional and stable interacting system as it will directly impact the user’s experience. All the interactions must be executed correctly with low latency and proper return from the application.</li>
        <li>Extra features: Along with the core functionality, we have decided that these functions will also be fully implemented in this project:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Search bar: Users should be able to use keywords such as the name of dishes, ingredients, or cooking method to find the desired posts. Filters can be added to optimize the user experience.</li>
            <li>Notifications: This function sends push notifications through web browsers to notify users about their activities on the app (reactions, or new followers).</li>
            <li>Built-in PDF converter for posts: a built-in converter that can convert a post into a printable PDF file that can be printed for offline storage or physical transportation.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
    <h3>2. Plans and Progress:</h3>
    <p>The original idea of this project, which came up by Chi Toan, was to create a platform for home cooks to share their recipes with others. The contents posted by users will have optimized arrangements which make it easy to write as well as easy to read. To bring this platform alive, we decided to divide the progress into different milestones to improve work efficiency. Due to the situation of the pandemic, the development of the platform is being slowed because of the difficulties in communication and interaction between team members.
      <br>The first phase is to create the web version of the apps with a functional UI and core databases. The main tasks of this phase are developing and having insiders test the system. At the end of this phase, the web version of the platform should be published and ready for phase two.
      <br>In phase two, also known as “The engagement phase”, when the platform is published. The marketing campaign will be implemented and user’s feedback will be collected for improvement. The goal of this phase is to earn a stable amount of users and income. These results will directly impact to the progress of phase three.
      <br>In phase three, which is also the final phase, the team will concentrate on creating the mobile app of the platform along with improving the current user’s experience. This will be the most challenging phase as the mobile version and the web version must be fully synchronized to keep the user experience fluent. From this phase, every member of the team will focus on improving the app as well as adding new features.
      <br>Progress:
      <br>Until September 14th, the report of the first phase are being finalized.<br>The first design of the UI have been publish to the team using Figma.</p>
    <h3>3. Roles:</h3>
    <p>Having 4 members in the team which combine from two 2-man teams, we decided to separate the team into frontend and backend teams which will balance our performance. Despite the separation and the difficulties of social distancing, our members have been effectively communicating and supporting each other.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frontend team, also known as User Interface Design Team, mainly operated by Chi Toan and Lam Tung. These are also the members that came up with the original idea about this project. The task of the team is to design a user-friendly interface that can impress and attract users to stay loyal with the platform.</li>
        <li>Backend team, operated by Anh Quan and Trung Hieu, also called Technical Developing Team. The team’s main job is to keep databases and interaction throughout the platform stable and fluent, which will improve user experience.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>4. Scope and Limits:</h3>

    <p>Any other features not included in this project are for further development which is also the limit of this project.</p>
    <h3>5. Tools and Technologies:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Database: In order to store a user’s account information, a working database such as MySQL is crucial.</li>
        <li>Materials: Adobe Photoshop Version 21.0.1.</li>
        <li>IDE for Website development: The website is coded by PHP or HTML language. PHPStorm or Netbeans should be great code editors.</li>
        <li>Prototype: Figma (latest Version).</li>
        <li>Project management: Evernote Version 10.21.5 to keep everyone’s work sync and on track.</li>
        <li>Note: Each member of our team still has little knowledge about programming or creating website</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>6. Testing:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Test users: the ideal number is 10 according to Nielsen and Landauer. These test users can be our friends or relatives who are familiar with using other social media platforms.</li>
        <li>First we will create a prototype by using Figma to test out the concept and ideas of the available features.</li>
        <li>No further testing that involves people outside of the team will be needed until the project is completely finished.</li>
        <li>Then we will conduct a main testing plan with the same people from the last test to compare the results.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>7. Timeframe:</h3>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3qGChkb.png" height="1107" weight="683">
    <h3>8. Risks:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>While doing the project on a laptop or any technology which serves for finishing the project, there would be some issues:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The person with the role of submitting the project cannot do it for some reasons. Solution: other members will do the submission.</li>
          <li>Accidents can happen, all the members cannot submit due to some technical problems. Solution: our project data is synced to the cloud (Google Drive), so one can just log in to another working device to download the file and submit.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Beside technical problems, health issues can also be challenge to deal with:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A member of the group got sick or had a physical injury that cannot make it to a meeting or even cannot join an meeting. Solution: we can rearrange the meeting to another day, or we can proceed without that person and give him the details later.</li>
          <li>Accidents can happen, a member of the group is in a very bad condition and has to permanently leave the group. Solution: A. continue the project with the current members. </li>
          <li>B. find another suitable member for the team and try to figure things out.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Softwares and tools can cause problems too:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The chosen software does not meet the expectation or is too difficult to work with. Solution: ask an expert or professor for help, or we modify the project features to meet with the current condition.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
    <h3>9. Group processes and communications:</h3>
      <p>How will your group communicate?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our group communicates through Messenger, discusses ideas  and works on the same online Google Doc. Furthermore, we will also work on the project on the Github Repository to keep track of the progress.</li>
        <li>When the social-distancing is over and we are all allowed to have meetings face to face, the plan is to meet up at public places like Coffee shops or at RMIT university.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How often will meetings take place?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Online meetings should happen everyday and anytime, especially when someone encounters a problem, they will ask in the Messenger group chat to discuss it with everyone.</li>
        <li>Face to Face should happen at least once a week around noon time to have further discussions about the project.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Will there be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook?</P>
      <ul>
        <li>As mentioned, we use Facebook Messenger to communicate. We actually don’t want and don’t need to have any face to face online meetings. Working through Github and Google Doc should be enough.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone has their own lifes, yes. However if one does not respond to any communications (Messenger, email, phone calls… ) and we can’t go out due to the lock-down, there’s not much we can do.</li>
        <li>If we can’t contact that person for too long (around 1 or 2 weeks straight), that person should take less credit or be left out of the project.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Skills and Jobs:</h2>
    <p>Despite a 6-month training program, all team members are RMIT freshmen with no prior experience in Python, Java, UI/UX, teamwork, or project implementation. Ours is still in the early stages. As a result, the members of the team decided to divide the work equally among themselves.
      <br>So, if a business decides to invest in the project, I'll need to hire four more potential employees.
      <br>The first priority will be to hire a CEO with experience in Inside Sales, Website Development, Employee Training, Management, Sales, Leadership, Social Media, Microsoft Excel, Team Building, and Human Resources to serve as a dependable project leader.
      <br>Following that will be the position of CTO (Chief Technology Officer), whose responsibilities will include providing a product vision, selecting appropriate technology, participating in recruitment, and managing human resources in order to achieve the common goal. MySQL, JavaScript, Engineering, Java, CSS, XML, HTML5, Web Development, Software Development, Git, Android Development, PHP, and Web Development are all required skills.
      <br>Next, the position of CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) will be hired to oversee all project promotion, business support, and commercial activities. PowerPoint, Social Media, Consulting, Public Speaking, Executive Management, Sales, Business Development, Market Research, Investments, English, Negotiation, and Business Analysis are among the skills required.
      <br>Finally, a senior developer in the industry will be appointed to the position of head of development. iOS development, AngularJS, User Interface Design, CSS, Android, Git, Web Development, JavaScript, MySQL, React.js, and Mobile Applications are all necessary skills.</p>
